The functionality is tested by optimizing sum of squared differences between the function outputs and a given height, which is provided as user input. The minimal value obtained is filtered to remove any outliers as convergence issues can be common in both CPU and GPU implementations. The mean value of these correctly converged solutions is then compared between the original L-BFGS and the L-BFGS_GPU implementation. The tests are done firstly for 50 variables, then for 500 variables and in the end for 1000 variables. This should ensure enough diversity for general function solution testing.","category":"page"},{"location":"tests.html","page":"Tests","title":"Tests","text":"Gaussian SSD tests","category":"page"},{"location":"tests.html","page":"Tests","title":"Tests","text":"beginequation\ntextSSD_textgauss = sum_i=1^n left( A expleft( -frac(x_i - mu)^22 sigma^2 right) - y_i right)^2\nendequation","category":"page"},{"location":"tests.html","page":"Tests","title":"Tests","text":"Gaussian with squared input SSD tests","category":"page"},{"location":"tests.html","page":"Tests","title":"Tests","text":"beginequation\ntextSSD_textgauss-sq = sum_i=1^n left( A expleft( -frac(x_i^2 - mu)^22 sigma^2 right) - y_i right)^2\nendequation","category":"page"},{"location":"tests.html","page":"Tests","title":"Tests","text":"You can run test cases as usual with command : test","category":"page"},{"location":"benchmarking.html#Benchmarking-L-BFGS-Optimization-with-and-without-CUDA-Acceleration","page":"Benchmarking","title":"Benchmarking L-BFGS Optimization with and without CUDA Acceleration","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"benchmarking.html","page":"Benchmarking","title":"Benchmarking","text":"The package can be used to evaluate the performance of the L-BFGS optimization method for various functions, both with and without CUDA acceleration.
